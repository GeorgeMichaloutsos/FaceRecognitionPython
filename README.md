# FaceRecognitionPython
FaceRecognitionPython is a Python project designed to use your camera for real-time face detection.
Moreover it captures screenshots with precise timestamps. 
This project provides a simple yet powerful tool for detecting faces using CV2 and taking snapshots conveniently with just a click. 
Each screenshot is automatically named with the exact date and time of capture, ensuring organized and easily retrievable records.
